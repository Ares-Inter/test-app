# Simple Webshop - React Coding Task

## Overview

Welcome to the Simple Webshop coding task! In this project, you'll be working with a basic React application that displays a list of products and allows users to add and remove items from a shopping cart.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed:

- **Node.js** (version 14.x or higher)
- **npm** (Node Package Manager, comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   ```
   (Replace `[repository-url]` with the actual URL of the repository.)

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd react-webshop
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This will install all the necessary packages required to run the application.

### Running the Application

To start the development server and run the application locally, use the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the React development server, and you can view the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
